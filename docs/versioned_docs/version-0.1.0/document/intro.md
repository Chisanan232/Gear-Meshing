# Introduction to Engineering AI Agent

Welcome to the Engineering AI Agent documentation. This project aims to develop advanced AI agents capable of performing various software engineering roles, automating tasks, and enhancing the development workflow.

## Project Overview

Engineering AI Agent is a comprehensive system designed to create AI agents that can perform various roles in the software development lifecycle:

- **Research & Development (RD)** - Code implementation, testing, and technical problem-solving
- **Quality Assurance (QA)** - Verifying and validating features, identifying bugs
- **Project Management (PM)** - Requirement analysis, task management, and coordination
- **System Architect (SA)** - Designing system architecture and technical specifications
- **Software Developer (SD)** - Implementing features and fixing bugs
- **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** - System monitoring and maintenance

In version 0.1.0, we're focusing on RD and PM roles as the initial implementation.

## Key Features

Engineering AI Agent offers the following capabilities:

### For Research & Development (RD)
- **Requirement Analysis** - Using spec-by-example methodology
- **Task Management** - Handling JIRA/ClickUp tickets through their lifecycle
- **Test-Driven Development** - Writing tests before implementation
- **Software Development** - Coding, debugging, and version control
- **Knowledge Research** - Web searching and knowledge organization for POCs
- **Code Review & Pull Requests** - Managing GitHub PRs and addressing feedback

### For Project Management (PM)
- **Requirement Analysis** - Deep dive into feature details and stakeholder needs
- **Task Breakdown** - Creating manageable tasks from larger requirements
- **Task Management** - Creating and assigning detailed tickets in JIRA/ClickUp

### Integrations

The system seamlessly connects with:

- **Slack** - For communication and task coordination
- **GitHub** - For source code version control
- **JIRA/ClickUp** - For task and project management
