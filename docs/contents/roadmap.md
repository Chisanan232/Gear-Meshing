## Feature Requests and Prioritization

We welcome feature requests from our community. The process for submitting and prioritizing features is:

1. Submit feature requests through GitHub Issues with the "feature request" label
2. The core team reviews requests on a bi-weekly basis
3. Approved features are added to the roadmap with tentative release targets
4. Community members can vote on feature requests to help prioritize development

## Experimental Features

Some features may be released as experimental before being integrated into the main product:

- **Agent Collaboration Simulation**
  - Simulate interactions between multiple roles
  - Test complex workflows with minimal human intervention

- **Natural Language Requirements**
