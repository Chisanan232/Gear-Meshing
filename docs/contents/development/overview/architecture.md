# Engineering AI Agent Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Engineering AI Agent system architecture. It is intended for developers and contributors who need to understand the system internals for development, debugging, or enhancement purposes.

## System Architecture Overview

The Engineering AI Agent system follows a microservices architecture pattern with event-driven communication between components. This approach allows for independent scaling, development, and deployment of individual components.

```

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Service Isolation**: Each component operates independently with well-defined interfaces
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging for loosely-coupled components
3. **Stateless Design**: Services maintain minimal state for scalability
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers throughout the system
5. **Observability First**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing

## Key Components

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client interactions with the system. It handles:

- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI

**Implementation Details:**
- Built with FastAPI for high performance and automatic OpenAPI docs
- JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions
- Request validation and sanitization
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis

### Role Services

Role Services implement the business logic for each AI agent role. Each role operates as an independent microservice:

- **RD (Research & Development)**: Handles code generation, testing, and PR management
- **PM (Project Management)**: Manages requirements analysis and task breakdown
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Implements test planning, execution, and bug reporting
- **SA (System Architect)**: Provides architecture recommendations and design patterns
- **SD (Software Developer)**: Focuses on implementation, refactoring, and code quality
- **SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and reliability

**Implementation Details:**
- Each role service is implemented as a separate Python microservice
- Shared code libraries for common functionality
- Role-specific business logic and prompting strategies
- Event-based communication for cross-role collaboration

### Integration Connectors

Integration Connectors facilitate communication with external systems:

- **Slack Connector**: Handles real-time messaging and interactions
- **GitHub Connector**: Manages repository operations, commits, and PRs
- **JIRA Connector**: Interfaces with JIRA for task management
- **ClickUp Connector**: Provides alternative task management integration

**Implementation Details:**
- Webhook receivers for real-time event handling
- OAuth 2.0 flow for user authorization
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Rate limit awareness for API calls
- Event publication for system-wide notifications

### LLM Orchestrator

The LLM Orchestrator manages interactions with AI providers:

- Provider selection and fallback strategies
- Prompt management and templating
- Context handling and token optimization
- Response processing and validation

**Implementation Details:**
- Abstract provider interface for multi-provider support
- Configurable model selection based on task requirements
- Context window management with chunking strategies
- Caching layer for efficient token usage
- Asynchronous API calls for improved throughput

## Communication Patterns

### Service-to-Service Communication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant APIGateway as API Gateway
    participant RoleService as Role Service
    participant IntegrationConnector as Integration Connector
    participant LLMOrchestrator as LLM Orchestrator
    participant TaskManager as Task Manager
    
    APIGateway->>RoleService: REST API Call
    RoleService->>LLMOrchestrator: gRPC Call
    LLMOrchestrator-->>RoleService: Response
    RoleService->>IntegrationConnector: Event Message
    RoleService->>TaskManager: Task Update
    TaskManager-->>RoleService: Task Status
```

Services communicate using a combination of:

1. **Synchronous REST API calls**: For request/response patterns that require immediate results
2. **gRPC calls**: For high-performance internal service communication
3. **Asynchronous messaging**: Using message queues for event-based communication
4. **Event streaming**: For real-time data flow between components

## Data Flow Architecture

    end
    
    %% Flow connections

    Process --> Storage
    Process --> Output
    Storage --> Process
```

## Database Schema Overview

The system uses multiple databases optimized for different purposes:

1. **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - User accounts and authentication
   - Task and workflow state
   - Configuration and settings
   - Relationship tracking

   - Operational logs
   - Audit trails
   - Usage statistics

## Scalability and High Availability

The system is designed for horizontal scalability:

1. **Stateless Services**: All services can be scaled horizontally

   - Read replicas for high-read scenarios
   - Sharding for write-heavy workloads
   - Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
3. **Regional Redundancy**:

## Security Architecture

        direction TB
        L1["Network Security"]
        L2["API Security"]
        L3["Service Security"]
        L4["Data Security"]
        
        L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L4
    end
    
    subgraph "Implementation"
        direction TB
        N1["VPC & Network ACLs"]

        A1["API Gateway Authentication"]
        A2["Rate Limiting"]
        S1["Service-to-Service Auth"]
        S2["Role-Based Access Control"]
        D1["Encryption at Rest"]
        D2["Encryption in Transit"]
        
        N1 -.-> L1
        N2 -.-> L1
