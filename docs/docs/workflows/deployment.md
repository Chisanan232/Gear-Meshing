# Deployment Workflow

This document describes the deployment workflow in the Engineering AI Agent system, focusing on how code changes move from development to production environments.

## Overview

The deployment workflow encompasses several stages:
1. Environment preparation
2. Build process
3. Testing in staging
4. Production deployment
5. Monitoring and rollback procedures

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Environment Preparation

**Primary Roles**: RD (Research & Development), SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

Before deployment, the environment is prepared:
- Configuration files are updated for the target environment
- Environment variables are set appropriately
- Infrastructure is provisioned if needed
- Dependencies are updated to required versions

Example environment configuration:
```yaml
# config/environment/staging.yaml
environment: staging
logging:
  level: info
  format: json
database:
  host: ${DB_HOST}
  port: ${DB_PORT}
  name: engineering_agent_staging
  pool_size: 10
services:
  slack:
    enabled: true
  github:
    enabled: true
  jira:
    enabled: true
  clickup:
    enabled: false
```

### 2. Build Process

**Primary Role**: CI/CD Pipeline

The build process prepares the application for deployment:
- Source code is fetched from the repository
- Dependencies are installed
- Code is compiled or bundled if necessary
- Tests are run to verify functionality
- Artifacts are packaged for deployment

Example build workflow:
```yaml
name: Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
    - name: Build package
      run: |
        pip install build
        python -m build
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: dist
        path: dist/
```

### 3. Testing in Staging

**Primary Roles**: QA (Quality Assurance), SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

Before production deployment, changes are tested in a staging environment:
- Built artifacts are deployed to the staging environment
- Integration with external services is verified
- Performance and security testing is performed
- User acceptance testing may be conducted
- Smoke tests verify basic functionality

Example staging deployment workflow:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    branches: [develop]
    types: [completed]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    steps:
    - name: Download artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: dist
        path: dist/
    - name: Deploy to staging
      env:
        DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        ./scripts/deploy.sh --env staging --token $DEPLOY_TOKEN
    - name: Run smoke tests
      run: |
        ./scripts/smoke_tests.sh --env staging
```

### 4. Production Deployment

**Primary Roles**: SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), RD (Research & Development)

Once verified in staging, changes are deployed to production:
- Deployment may follow different strategies (blue/green, canary, etc.)
- Database migrations are applied if necessary
- Configuration is updated for production
- Traffic is gradually shifted to the new version
- Deployment is monitored for issues

Example production deployment workflow:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to deploy'
        required: true
      strategy:
        description: 'Deployment strategy'
        required: true
        default: 'blue-green'
        type: choice
        options:
        - blue-green
        - canary
        - rolling

jobs:
  deploy-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout deploy scripts
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        sparse-checkout: scripts/
    - name: Deploy to production
      env:
        DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PROD_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
        VERSION: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
        STRATEGY: ${{ github.event.inputs.strategy }}
      run: |
        ./scripts/deploy.sh --env production --token $DEPLOY_TOKEN --version $VERSION --strategy $STRATEGY
    - name: Verify deployment
      run: |
        ./scripts/verify_deployment.sh --env production
```

### 5. Monitoring and Rollback

**Primary Role**: SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

After deployment, the system is monitored:
- Performance metrics are tracked
- Error rates are monitored
- User-impacting issues are identified
- Rollback procedures are executed if necessary

Example monitoring alert configuration:
```yaml
# prometheus-alerts.yaml
groups:
- name: engineering_agent_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0.05
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High error rate detected
      description: Error rate exceeded 5% for more than 2 minutes

  - alert: SlowResponses
    expr: http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.9"} > 2
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: Slow API responses detected
      description: 90th percentile response time is above 2 seconds for 5 minutes
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

- Two identical environments are maintained (Blue and Green)
- Changes are deployed to the inactive environment
- Tests verify the new deployment
- Traffic is switched from the active to the inactive environment
- Allows for immediate rollback by switching traffic back

### Canary Deployment

- New version is deployed alongside the old version
- Small percentage of traffic is routed to the new version
- Traffic percentage gradually increases if no issues are found
- Allows for early detection of issues with minimal impact
- Rollback requires scaling down the new version

### Rolling Deployment

- New version is deployed gradually across instances
- One or more instances are updated at a time
- Healthchecks verify each updated instance
- Process continues until all instances are updated
- Balances deployment speed with risk mitigation

## Versioning and Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

The system follows semantic versioning (SemVer):
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`)
- MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Branching Strategy

- `main` branch represents the current production state
- `develop` branch is used for ongoing development
- Feature branches branch off from and merge back to `develop`
- Release branches are created from `develop`
- Hotfixes branch directly from `main` and merge to both `main` and `develop`

### Release Process

1. Create a release branch (`release/vX.Y.Z`) from `develop`
2. Perform final testing and bug fixes in the release branch
3. Merge the release branch to `main`
4. Tag the release in `main` (`vX.Y.Z`)
5. Merge the release branch back to `develop`

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management

- Environment-specific configuration remains separate from code
- Sensitive values are stored in secure vaults
- Configuration is versioned and auditable
- Changes to configuration follow the same review process as code

### Database Changes

- Database migrations are automated
- Migrations are backward compatible when possible
- Large data migrations are performed in batches
- Rollback procedures are defined for database changes

### Deployment Safety

- Feature flags control functionality exposure
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Rate limiting protects against unexpected load
- Automated rollbacks trigger on error thresholds

### Documentation and Communication

- Release notes document all changes
- Stakeholders are notified before significant deployments
- Post-deployment status is communicated to the team
- Deployment schedules respect low-traffic periods

## Example Workflow

1. **Release Planning**:
   - Features are prioritized for the next release
   - Version number is assigned based on changes
   - Release branch is created from `develop`

2. **Preparation**:
   - Final testing is performed in the release branch
   - Release notes are prepared
   - Deployment plan is reviewed

3. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Release is deployed to staging environment
   - Integration and acceptance testing is performed
   - Issues are fixed directly in the release branch

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Stakeholders are notified of the upcoming deployment
   - Deployment is scheduled during a low-traffic period
   - Release is deployed following the chosen strategy

5. **Post-Deployment**:
   - System is monitored for anomalies
   - Success or issues are communicated to the team
   - Lessons learned are documented for future deployments
