## AI Strategy

The Engineering AI Agent employs a multi-model, multi-paradigm approach to AI implementation with the following key principles:

1. **Specialization**: Each engineering role is modeled by specialized AI services tailored to that role's responsibilities.
2. **Collaboration**: AI services communicate and collaborate through a standardized event-driven architecture.
3. **Augmentation**: The system is designed to augment human engineers, not replace them.
4. **Continuous Learning**: Models are continuously improved through feedback loops and fine-tuning.
5. **Transparency**: All AI decisions are explainable and traceable.
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple redundancy and fallback strategies ensure reliability.
7. **Contextual Awareness**: Knowledge base integration provides rich context for decisions.
