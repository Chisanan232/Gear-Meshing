# Engineering AI Agent System Design

This document provides detailed insights into the system design of the Engineering AI Agent platform, covering design principles, patterns, and implementation strategies.

## Design Principles

The Engineering AI Agent platform is built on the following core design principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is composed of loosely coupled components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

2. **Extensibility**: The architecture allows for easy addition of new roles, integrations, and features without significant changes to the existing codebase.

3. **Scalability**: All components are designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load.

4. **Resilience**: The system incorporates fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and self-healing mechanisms.

5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing enable effective monitoring and debugging.

6. **Security**: Security is integrated into every layer of the system, following the principle of defense in depth.

## System Components Design

### API Gateway Design

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client] --> APIGW[API Gateway]
    
    subgraph APIGateway
        Router[Request Router]
        Auth[Authentication]
        RateLimit[Rate Limiter]
        Validator[Request Validator]
        Docs[API Documentation]
    end
    
    APIGW --> Router
    Router --> Auth
    Auth --> RateLimit
    RateLimit --> Validator
    Validator --> Services[Internal Services]
    
    APIGW --> Docs
```

#### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Technology Choice**: FastAPI provides high performance with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
2. **Authentication Strategy**: 
   - JWT-based authentication for stateless operation
   - OAuth 2.0 flow for third-party integration
   - API keys for machine-to-machine communication
3. **Rate Limiting Implementation**: 
   - Distributed rate limiting using Redis
   - Configurable limits based on user tiers
   - Graceful rejection with retry-after headers
4. **Request Validation**: 
   - Pydantic models for schema validation
   - Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
5. **Routing Strategy**:
   - Role-specific endpoints for direct access
   - Generic endpoints for cross-role functionality
   - Versioned API paths for backward compatibility

### Role Services Design

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph RoleServices[Role Services Architecture]
        RoleAPI[Role API Layer]
        RoleCore[Role Core Logic]
        PromptManager[Prompt Management]
        EventEmitter[Event System]
        StateManager[State Management]
    end
    
    RoleAPI --> RoleCore
    RoleCore --> PromptManager
    RoleCore --> EventEmitter
    RoleCore --> StateManager
    
    PromptManager --> LLM[LLM Orchestrator]
    EventEmitter --> EventBus[Event Bus]
    StateManager --> DB[Database]
```

#### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Role Separation**: Each role (RD, PM, QA, etc.) is implemented as a separate microservice for independent development and scaling.

2. **Common Framework**: 
   - Shared base classes for common functionality
   - Role-specific extensions for specialized behavior
   - Dependency injection for flexible component composition

3. **State Management**:
   - Primarily stateless design
   - Persistent state stored in databases
   - Distributed caching for performance
   - Event sourcing for complex state transitions

4. **Event System**:
   - Event-driven architecture for cross-service communication
   - Publish-subscribe pattern for loose coupling
   - Event schemas for type-safe messaging

5. **Role-Specific Logic Encapsulation**:
   - Strategy pattern for interchangeable algorithms
   - Factory pattern for creating appropriate handlers
   - Template method pattern for workflow standardization

### Integration Connectors Design

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph IntegrationConnectors[Integration Connectors]
        WebhookReceiver[Webhook Receiver]
        APIClient[API Client]
        EventHandler[Event Handler]
        AuthManager[Auth Manager]
        RateLimiter[Rate Limiter]
    end
    
    WebhookReceiver --> EventHandler
    APIClient --> RateLimiter
    APIClient --> AuthManager
    EventHandler --> InternalEvents[Internal Event Bus]
    
    ExternalService[External Service] <--> WebhookReceiver
    ExternalService <--> APIClient
```

#### Key Design Decisions:

2. **Abstraction Layers**:
   - Service-specific API clients
   - Common webhook handling framework
   - Shared authentication patterns
   - Standardized event transformation

3. **Authentication Patterns**:

   - API tokens for system-authenticated access
   - Secure storage of credentials in vault services
   - Token refresh mechanisms

4. **Rate Limit Management**:
   - Adaptive rate limiting based on provider constraints
   - Queuing mechanisms for high-volume operations
   - Backpressure handling for overload scenarios

5. **Event Translation**:

    ContextManager --> ExternalLLM[External LLM Provider]
    ExternalLLM --> ResponseProcessor
    
    PromptLibrary[Prompt Library] --> PromptEngine

```

#### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Provider Abstraction**:
   - Interface-based design for multi-provider support
   - Adapter pattern for provider-specific implementations
   - Strategy pattern for model selection logic

2. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Template-based prompt generation
   - Version-controlled prompt library
   - Parameter interpolation for dynamic prompts
   - Few-shot example management

3. **Context Management**:
   - Efficient token usage through summarization
   - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge incorporation
   - Sliding window approach for conversation history
   - Context priority ranking for token optimization

4. **Response Processing**:
   - Schema validation of LLM responses
   - Fallback strategies for invalid responses
   - Post-processing for consistency
   - Classification and extraction of structured data

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Asynchronous API calls
   - Response caching
   - Batching of similar requests
   - Stream processing for long responses

## Event-Driven Architecture

    subgraph Publishers[Event Publishers]
        SlackConnector[Slack Connector]
        GitHubConnector[GitHub Connector]
        RoleServices[Role Services]
    end
    
    subgraph EventBus[Event Bus]
        Topics[Topics/Channels]
        Queue[Message Queue]
    end
    
    subgraph Subscribers[Event Subscribers]
        TaskManager[Task Manager]
        NotificationService[Notification Service]
        AnalyticsService[Analytics Service]
    end
    
    Publishers --> EventBus
    EventBus --> Subscribers
```

### Event Types

1. **Integration Events**:
   - `slack.message.received`
   - `github.pr.created`
   - `jira.ticket.updated`
